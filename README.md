# IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis

Nowadays there is such a vast amount of data available to people, certainly too much for any one individual to look through. Text itself presents a specific problem where reading and understanding text. I seek to try to solve this problem using NLP and Neural Networks to determine if we can comphrehend the underlying sentiment of the text presented.

Step by step procedure: 

Today we will be looking at deep learning and learn about how we can use deep learning and natural language processing to try to create a system that can read a user's review and analyze whether they found the film to be a positive or negative experience. We first begin by importing our necessary databases as well as pandas. â€‹

We then concatenate our two dataframes and then begin the process of cleaning and preparing the data. First, I suppose it's important to explain why cleaning and preparing our data are so important. Basically, it would take a tremendous amount of work to teach a learning algorithm on how all the rules of the English language work. A computer can't readily tell that 'car', 'Car', 'car.' and 'Car.' could all be the same thing. The best thing for it is to lowercase all terms within the dataframe and remove all punctuation from it so that it can more easily identify the same word. Another thing we notice in our work is the presence of line breaks, which are present here as '<br>'. Removing these poses an additional challenge because simply removing the brackets outside of it will cause 'br' to be left, either alone, or depending or spacing, it can even concatenate itself onto another word, thereby preventing it from being correctly tokenized. We address this problem by using the strip function and stripping all instances of linebreaks from the strings.
